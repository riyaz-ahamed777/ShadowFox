# ShadowFox

Welcome to my repository for the *Java Development Internship* at *ShadowFox Technologies*. This internship helped me strengthen my core Java skills through practical, task-based learningâ€”from beginner-level programs to advanced real-world applications.

## Internship Overview

This internship was structured around three levels of tasks:

- *Beginner Level:* Focus on basic Java syntax, console-based apps, and CRUD logic.
- *Intermediate Level:* Introduced GUI development, unit testing, and data persistence.
- *Advanced Level:* Real-world application development using networking, REST APIs, and microservices.

Each task was completed according to the internship guidelines, and the code was written, tested, and documented independently.
