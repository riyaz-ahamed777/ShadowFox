# ShadowFox

Welcome to my repository for the *Java Development Internship* at *ShadowFox*. This internship helped me strengthen my core Java skills through practical, task-based learningâ€”from beginner-level programs to advanced real-world applications.

## Internship Overview

This internship was structured around three levels of tasks:

- *Beginner Level:* Focus on basic Java syntax, console-based apps, and CRUD logic.
- *Intermediate Level:* Introduced GUI development, unit testing, and data persistence.
- *Advanced Level:* Real-world application development using networking, REST APIs, and microservices.

Each task was completed according to the internship guidelines, and the code was written, tested, and documented independently.

## Advanced Task Completed: Real-time Chat Application

### Project Overview

This Java-based real-time chat application allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and communicate simultaneously. It is built using *Java Socket Programming* and *Multithreading*.

### Key Features

- Real-time message exchange
- Multiple client support via threads
- Username-based identification
- Notifications for user join and exit events
- Efficient client handling using a Set<ClientHandler>

### Technologies Used

- Java SE
- Socket Programming
- Multithreading
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)

### Key Learnings

- Network programming using sockets
- Handling concurrent client connections
- Message broadcasting and synchronization
- Clean code structure using separate classes for server, client, and handler
